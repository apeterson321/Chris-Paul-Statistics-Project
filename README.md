# Chris Paul Linear Regression Project

The goal of this project was to build a model that helps my client, Chris Paul, identify the statistics that most affect his offensive ability –– specifically, points scored per game. I scraped over 1,000 rows of game statistics from Chris Paul page on Basketball Reference and built a linear regression model. This model determined significant statistics that either deter or contribute to points scored per game, and building a strategy on these key statistics will produce more points per game.
